                    <p>Produced a static website created to promote restaurant features such as a visually appealing 
                        menu with descriptions of each main or side dish, followed by information related to the source 
                        of the restaurant’s ingredients. Website visitors also see images of the physical restaurant to 
                        showcase restaurant atmosphere. Users may navigate through the website via labeled buttons, or 
                        the dropdown menu buttons, if the screen is smaller than six-hundred pixels wide.</p>

                    <p>Collaborated with three teammates to build a Java application to serve both architects and 
                        interior designers. The application allows them to design a full structure with walls, windows, 
                        doors, fixed and unfixed furnishings. Additionally, our application allowed the user to adjust the 
                        size, save the design, and print their concept on paper.
